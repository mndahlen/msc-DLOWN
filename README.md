See the [thesis report](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-9078&pid=diva2%3A1780605&c=3&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=martin+dahl&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all) for details, code corresponding to plots is found in demo.py. 
I have provided a requirements.txt with all the packages I used in my virtual env running this project. Some of the packages are not necessarily required.
